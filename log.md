# 100 Days of code - Log

## Day 0: February, 02, 2022

### Today's Progress:

> Set up this repo to keep track of all of my progress.
> I also worked on creating a database for my portfolio so I could store my projects outside of my frontend project. Worked on a separate Code Wars challenge with Landon and Michel.
> The challenge was to convert a string into a number. My answer is below:

```
var stringToNumber = function(str){
  return parseInt(str);
}
```

### Thoughts:

> Working on the Code Challenge was fun! It was on the easier side, but I believe that getting the reps in is important. I also am having fun creating the backend for my portfolio. I can't wait to implement this into the frontend and connect all of the dots!
